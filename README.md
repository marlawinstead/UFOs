Creating a webpage using JavaScript

Overview

The purpose of this project is to assist Dana, a data journalist, to show UFO sightings on a website. We’ve designed a table using JavaScript and taken advantage of the visual functionality JavaScript has in order to show the data on a webpage. The goal is for a user to filter the data by various criteria and see results.

Results

The webpage shows a background on UFO sightings and the controversy surrounding them. Below the paragraph summary, you will find the searches for each type of data that can be filtered through. The filters are for date, city, state, country, and shape. A user is able to enter a selection into any of these filters to see results that match their criteria. This is shown in the below images.

Summary

One of the drawbacks of this webpage, is that JavaScript is case sensitive. This is necessary to know for the user when making searches for data. For example, if a user is to type “NC” into the state search filter, no results are returned. However, if they type “nc” into the search filter, 4 results are returned.

There are a few recommendations to make the webpage better. In order to make the webpage more user-friendly, it would be beneficial to make a drop-down search for each of the filters. For example, under the “shape” filter, you would be provided a drop-down option in order to know which shapers were available, because “shape” can be such a broad term. The same would apply to every filter so that a search would always yield at least one result.
